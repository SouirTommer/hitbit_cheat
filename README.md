# AutoStepLogger

AutoStepLogger is a simple toolkit that helps users upload simulated steps to a Fitbit account (for example, automatically upload 10,000 steps every day). This repository contains two main scripts:

- `fitbit_login.py` — Run locally to perform OAuth login and produce `fitbit_tokens.json` (access + refresh token).
- `fitbit_host.py` — Run on a host (e.g. PythonAnywhere) to read `fitbit_tokens.json` and `fitbit_config.json`, refresh tokens when required, and upload steps.
- `fitbit_config.json` — Configuration template (replace with your own credentials).

Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- requests: `pip install requests`
- A Fitbit developer application: https://dev.fitbit.com/apps/new

Quick Overview
1. Register a Fitbit application (https://dev.fitbit.com/apps/new), add `http://127.0.0.1:8080/` as Redirect URL, and copy your OAuth 2.0 Client ID and Client Secret value.
2. Fill `fitbit_config.json` (OAuth 2.0 Client ID value and Client Secret value) with your credentials.
3. Run `fitbit_login.py` locally to authorize and generate `fitbit_tokens.json`.
4. Upload `fitbit_host.py`, `fitbit_config.json`, and `fitbit_tokens.json` to your host (e.g. PythonAnywhere).
5. Schedule `fitbit_host.py` to run daily.

## Step-by-step tutorial

Step 0 — Create a Fitbit App
1. Go to https://dev.fitbit.com/apps and create a new app (or edit an existing one).
2. Add Redirect URL: `http://127.0.0.1:8080/` (must exactly match the redirect_uri used by the login script).
For example:
<img width="594" height="846" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8de82355-47f8-4870-a705-cb563d2f51eb" />

3. Save and copy the `OAuth 2.0 Client ID` and `Client Secret value` !!!! and paste values to `fitbit_config.json`.

Step 1 — Prepare config (local)
Edit `fitbit_config.json` in the project directory and fill in your values. Example:

```json
{
  "client_id": "Your_OAuth 2.0 Client ID",
  "client_secret": "Your_Client_Secret",
  "redirect_uri": "http://127.0.0.1:8080/",
  "scope": "activity",
  "default_port": 8080,
  "daily_steps": 10000,
  "start_time": "08:00"
}
```

Step 2 — Run local login to obtain tokens
1. Install requests if needed:
   ```
   pip install requests
   ```
2. Run:
   ```
   python fitbit_login.py
   ```
3. The script opens your browser to the Fitbit authorization page. Sign in and click "Allow".

4. The local server will capture the authorization code and exchange it for tokens.
5. The script writes `fitbit_tokens.json`. Keep this file private.
6. You can try to run the `fitbit_host.py`. It should increase 10k steps on your Fitbit.

Step 3 — Prepare host environment (this example uses PythonAnywhere)
1. Register a PythonAnywhere account
2. Click the `Dashboard` -> `Files` page
3. Click `New file`
4. Upload these files to your host:
   - `fitbit_host.py`
   - `fitbit_config.json` (with your client_id/client_secret)
   - `fitbit_tokens.json` (from Step 2)
5. — Schedule daily run
  Client the `Tasks` → Scheduled tasks
  - Command:
    ```
    python3 /home/yourusername/fitbit_host.py
    ```
  - Remember PythonAnywhere uses UTC. Convert your desired time to UTC. (UTC 2:00 am = HK time 10:00 am). If you don't understand, just fill 2:00

Common issues & troubleshooting
- invalid_request - Invalid redirect_uri parameter value:
  - Ensure the redirect URI you registered on Fitbit exactly matches `redirect_uri` in `fitbit_config.json` (include trailing slash and port).
- No code after clicking Allow:
  - Confirm your local server is listening on the same port defined in `redirect_uri` and that no firewall blocks it.
- Refresh token fails:
  - If refresh_token is revoked or expired, re-run `fitbit_login.py` locally to obtain a new `fitbit_tokens.json`.

License
- Add a license file to your repo (MIT recommended) if you want others to reuse the code.
